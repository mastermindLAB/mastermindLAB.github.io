# Titanic tragedy: finding and analyzing the survivor rate. Its been
##### Data set were available at kaggel, find this projects on my kaggle [kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/suranjitbanik/seaborn-numpy-pandas-in-titanic-dataset).

I's been more then 100 years since Titanic disaster happened. When the "unsinkable" ship, the largest, most luxurious ocean liner of its time, crashed into an iceberg on its maiden voyage in 1912, it took more than 1,500 of its 2,200 passengers to the bottom.
> What was the reason of the strategy!

> Who were the passengers?

> Where are from, which city?

> What was the economical condition of the city of that time!

> Which passengers class was most affected on this disaster.

> Were they child, male or female!

> Who survived most was it single passenger or with family. Who were prioritize!

Cool lets answer all this question one by one form the dataset set I got. I will be using python library `numpy` and `pandas` to clean and manipulate the data. `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to visualize and analyze the data.

Ok lets dig deeper into ðŸš¢ :boat:
